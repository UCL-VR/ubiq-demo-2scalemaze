3. CONTRIBUTIONS
However grateful we are to people who want to contribute realize that there are a few items you need to consider before contributing:

    By uploading or any other way of delivering the creative material to imageafter.com you confirm that you are the originator of the creative material and have full originator and utilization rights. Meaning: do not upload photos that are not yours to give away.
    Photos taken on private properties need to have permission of the property owner and artist before you are allowed to upload them. For example: if you take a picture of an sculpture at an exhibition that is held in a non public space you need to ask permission of the artist and exhibition owner before you may contribute that image.
    We cannot recall the images once they are on the Internet - even if we remove them from the site - so be sure you are willing to part with them for good. We will credit you for the contribution (more so in the future than now is the case).
    All emerging costs due to offenses are at your expense. Meaning you remain responsible for what you upload or deliver so make sure you are the originator of the creative material and have the utilization rights as mentioned above.

Please contact us if you want to contribute and we will give you upload instructions
