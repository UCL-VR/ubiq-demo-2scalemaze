The Samples folder demonstrates how to use Ubiq.

The Social scene is where to start. It contains a social application which uses all of Ubiq's features.

The Boids folder contains an example of a networked application without the additional functionality in the social sample (Avatars, UI, etc).

The MinimalExamples folder contains single-purpose minimal working examples. These show how to achieve specific goals (such as spawning objects) in isolation, so you can see how they work.

All of the assets in the samples are CC0, meaning you can re-use them as you wish, including in closed source & commercial products.
